 1/ generate a correct makefile that can compile program_inverse_problem.90

  this program need almost routines used by specfem3D, since specfem3D is
  called inside. Additionnaly this program require :

   inversion_mod.f90
   adjoint_source_mod.f90
   deriv_DF_mod.f90
   dsm_coupling_mod.f90
   tv_reg.f90
   project_tomo_grid_mod.f90

 2/ need to add a flag USE_INVERSE_PROBLEM in specfem3D. When this flag is
true, we need to avoid writing kernels in the disk (previouly the writing was
in save adjoint_kernels.f90).


 3/ we need to duplicate some routines :
     init_simu
     prepare_timerun
     init_simu_adj

  those subroutine are used in program_inverse_problem.90 but the problem
  comming from allocation done inside. For the first call allocation aer done,
  the problem occurs in the second call because the arrays are already
  allocated. So I just copied/pasted thoses subroutines and commented the
  allocation and renamed them:
     re_init_simu
     re_prepare_timerun
     re_init_simu_adj
 We need to think what is the good impelentation way for the current version
  on specfem3D.

4/ the paralellisation is not done on sources only on domain decomposition.
